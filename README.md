## Front end todo's
- Right now will only get one possible terminus. But we want all possible. 
- Should limit destination locations to the stations?
- allow users to pick destinations
- show following train (each time through times, store previous)
- back button
- login

# Back end todo's
- firebase backend 
-- allows users to login, save their location
